## Background and Motivation
Ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) is a cutting-edge platform that maintains isolated human lungs in a physiologically active state outside the body, enabling comprehensive functional assessment and targeted therapeutic interventions. The concept of a “digital twin” – a dynamic, high-fidelity computational replica of a physical system – is rapidly gaining traction in medicine for its ability to simulate complex biological processes in silico.

Leveraging these advances, we have curated the world’s largest annotated dataset of ex vivo human lungs. Using this rich dataset, our digital twin of ex vivo human lungs accurately forecasts over 75 key parameters of lung function (e.g., compliance, gas exchange, etc.) and has been validated as a robust digital control for preclinical therapeutics.

This repository contains the complete end-to-end pipeline, including model training scripts, inference modules, Docker containers, and an interactive web application, aiming to make the repository transparent, user-friendly, and conducive to further inspection, validation, and improvement by the broader research community.

## DT Workflow
---

> 💡 **Did you know?** This model is trained on the largest dataset of its kind.

---

### Code Structure

The digital-twin pipeline in this repository is implemented using two core machine learning architectures: gated recurrent units (GRU) and XGBoost (XGB). The `GRU/` and `XGB/` directories each contain everything needed for model training, including data loading and preprocessing scripts, model architecture definitions and calibration, and utility functions that support the training pipeline. 

All inference scripts are located in the `inference/` folder, which provides code to load a trained model and generate predicted lung function parameters. For detailed instructions on running inference and building your own digital twin, please see the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section above and choose the inference method (command-line, Docker, Google Colab, or web-based app) that best suits you.

### Naming convention
This project follows a custom naming convention for model configurations and variable identifiers. Detailed explanations are provided below to enhance clarity and improve code readability.

#### GRU model training setups

A breath setup defines which breaths are included as input and output data to the model. They include:

`A1_A2` Setups for Static digital lung forecasting:

- `A1F50_A2F50`
- `A1F50L50_A2F50`
- `N1L20A1F50L50_A2F50`

`A1PA2_A3` Setups for Static digital lung forecasting:

- `A1F50PA2F50_A3F50`
- `A1F50L50PA2F50_A3F50`
- `N1L20A1F50L50PA2F50_A3F50`

`A1_A3` Setups for Static digital lung forecasting:

- `A1F50_A3F50`
- `A1F50L50_A3F50`
- `N1L20A1F50L50_A3F50`

`A1A2_A3` Setups for Dynamic digital lung forecasting: 

- `A1F50A2F50_A3F50`
- `A1F50L50A2F50_A3F50`
- `N1L20A1F50L50A2F50_A3F50`

Legend: `A = assessment period`, `N = normal breathing period`, `F = first breaths`, `L = last breaths` , `numbers = the number of breaths included`

*Note: everything before `_` is the input variables and everything after `_` is the target variable.*

#### GRU model variables

The variable defines which parameter will be forecasted. They include: 
- Dynamic Compliance (`Dy_Comp`)
- Peak Pressure (`P_peak`)
- Mean Pressure (`P_mean`)
- Expiratory Volume (`Ex_vol`)

#### XGBoost model training setups

`H1_to_H2`: Static digital lung forecasting (Forecast 2nd hour lung function using 1st hour baseline data)

`H1_to_H3`: Static digital lung forecasting (Forecast 3rd hour lung function using 1st hour baseline data)

`H1_predH2_to_H3`: Static digital lung forecasting (Forecast 3rd hour lung function using 1st hour baseline data and predicted 2nd hour data)

`H1_H2_to_H3`: Dynamic digital lung forecasting (Forecast 3rd hour lung function using 1st and 2nd hour obsereved data)

#### XGBoost model variables

Due to a large number of parameters, see [`GLOSSARY.md`](https://github.com/Sage-Lab-ai/DT_Lung/blob/main/GLOSSARY.md) for all abbreviation definitions.
